# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This repository was created to allow me to better prepare myself for the upcoming bootcamp. Allowing me to get familiar with Git Bash and learning how to use the command line to navigate, create and push/pull files. While I have some experience with HTML & CSS, I am fairly new to JavaScript so it was nice to be able to practice a few things using JavaScript, and being able to use the DevTools console to see some of my work in action.
 
It has allowed me to get more comfortable with starting the bootcamp and recognizing that as much as I would like to know as much as I possibly can right now, I will have to be patient and be consistent in my efforts to learn all the different facets of programming. Not only learning how to use the different languages that I will need to know and how to most efficiently use those languages, but also learning how to best work with other programmers and keeping collaboration in mind when coding.
